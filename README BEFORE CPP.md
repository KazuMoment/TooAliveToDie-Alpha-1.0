# TooAliveToDie-Alpha-1.0
A simple text adventure game in C++ WIP

Due to cicumstances of compilers needing a linker for using lwinmm for PlaySound() to work, it is recommeded to do any of the methods below:
- Compile the cpp in MSVC
- If using g++ or gcc or CodeBlocks or any compiler that cannot find lwinmm, use a linker for lwinmm
- Run the already compiled .exe file in the folder

If you want to run the .exe file instead:
- Run the .exe file
- A popup should appear, showing a "Don't Run" option. Go to more details or show more
- Click "Run Anyway"
